# US Patents Case Study

In this case study we utilized [USPTO PatentsView](https://patentsview.org/) data on granted patents from 1976-2021 to compare the participation of women inventors in civil engineering and pharmaceuticals patents.  The designation of civil engineering or pharmaceuticals is determined by the WIPO code associated with each patent.  These two fields were chosen based on their participation rate for women on patents. Civil engineering patents have a very low percentage of female patent inventors, whereas pharmaceutical patents have a higher percentage.

Topics investigated included inventor location, inventor collaborations and gender composition, and comparing name gendering techniques.   We also performed a literature review and suggested potential policy to increase participation of inventors who are women.

**Organization of Repo**

* 01_documents: literature related to the project

* 02_data: raw data and datasets created by wrangling the raw data.  Source code to prepare                   datasets is included. 

* 03_source_code: source code for the three main project topics: inventor location, inventor collaborations and gender composition, and comparing name gendering techniques

* 04_products: project presentation slides, tables created during the collaboration and inventor location analyses, and a link to interactive inventor location visualizations.
