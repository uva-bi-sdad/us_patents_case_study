# US Patents Case Study

In this case study we utilized [USPTO PatentsView](https://patentsview.org/) data on granted patents from 1I976-2021 to compare the participation of women inventors in civil engineering and pharmaceuticals patents.  The designation of civil engineering or pharmaceuticals is determined by the WIPO code associated with each patent.  

Topics investigated included inventor location, inventor collaborations and gender composition, and comparing name gendering techniques.   We also performed a literature review and suggested potential policy to increase participation of inventors who are women.
