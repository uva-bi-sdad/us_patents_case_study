# US Patents Case Study

In this case study we utilized [USPTO PatentsView](https://patentsview.org/) data on granted patents from 1976-2021 to compare the participation of women inventors in civil engineering and pharmaceuticals patents.  The designation of civil engineering or pharmaceuticals is determined by the WIPO code associated with each patent.  

We explored patents for two fields: civil engineering and pharmaceuticals fields. These two fields were chosen based on their participation rate for women on patents. Civil engineering has a very low rate of patent inventors who are women, whereas pharmaceuticals has a very high rate.

Topics investigated included inventor location, inventor collaborations and gender composition, and comparing name gendering techniques.   We also performed a literature review and suggested potential policy to increase participation of inventors who are women.
