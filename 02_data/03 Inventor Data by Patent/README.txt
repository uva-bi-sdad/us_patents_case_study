For both datasets, an observation (row) contains information for a unique patent-inventor-location triple.  

- A patent can have multiple inventors.
- On a single patent, an inventor can only have one location.  (However, an inventor with multiple patents could have different locations listed for each patent.)

The datasets were compressed in order to be shared on GitHub.
